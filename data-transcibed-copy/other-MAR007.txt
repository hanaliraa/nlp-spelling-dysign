My favourite game is football it is a game of 11 to 12 players in in every player had to be active to kick the ball.In the teem there would be a goal keeper who would have to defend the goal by the other team's player and there would be a defender who would have to defend the area were the goal might be and if the others team player gets to their feild the defender. should kick the ball out of their feild and their would be a striker who would have to go to the other teams feild and kick the ball to the others teams goal and so then the team will get point and the team who has the greater points would win.
